# Should Introverts watch Videos at 1x Speed?
Many people like to speed-up their videos / podcasts / audiobooks. It makes sense — we can process information much quicker
than we can speak it. I personally like somewhere between 1.5–1.8x speed. But if you are an introvert (or more generally, someone who just doesn't have a lot of daily
conversations), maybe it's a good idea to slow that media down.

When the time you hear people speaking in digital media outweighs the time you hear people talking live, it's
easy to start modeling your own speech after the former. So if I'm regularly exposed to people talking abnormally fast,
*I begin talking abnormally fast.*

This is at least a trend I've noticed in myself. Since then, I like to have a balance between normal and sped-up content.
Good speakers I especially try to keep at unmodified speeds.

I've thought to myself — do I really want to spend more time consuming the content than I need to? I think so, because you absorb
(whether intentionally or not) more than just the content itself.

Or I could just be overthinking it and nothing matters. Who knows. 🤷🏻‍♂️
