# Do you have a mask?
When I need to be productive, I go to Starbucks. The minor social pressures of being in a public setting keep me
focused in ways I can't be at home.

I've spent so much time at Starbucks that I could write novels about the crazy interactions I've observed among strangers and staff
from the view of my little corner Starbucks table.

One trend I noticed during the Covid pandemic is that employees would always ask customers without a face mask,
"Do you have a mask?" before offering one. It didn't matter which location or which employee. The question was always,
"Do you have a mask?", not "Can you please wear a mask?" or "You need a mask to enter here." like I heard in so many other
stores.

I do not work at Starbucks, so I can't say for sure whether these were top-down directions from corporate or just some
cosmic coincidence, but the phrase is subtly great.

It makes no judgements about the person, decreasing the chance that the person would become defensive. From the perspective
of an aggressive actor, they have nothing to fight back on because the question isn't demanding anything of them (though
implicitly it really is). It is just a question of whether they have a mask with them or not.

They are already in the door, and they are being offered the key to get their drink - a little surgical mask. In the moment it seems
so trivial a tradeoff to either put on a mask or have their journey to get to the store be for nothing.

I noticed (though without any formal data), that much more customers would take the mask over leaving the store than customers in similar interactions at
other non-Starbucks stores.
