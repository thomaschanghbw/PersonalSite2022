# Do you have a mask?
When I need to be productive, I go to Starbucks. The minor social pressures of being in a public setting keep me
focused in ways I can't be at home.

I've spent so much time at Starbucks that I could write novels about the crazy interactions I've observed among strangers and staff
from the view of my corner Starbucks table.

One trend I noticed during the Covid pandemic is that employees would always ask customers without a face mask,
"Do you have a mask?" before offering one. It didn't matter which location or which employee. The question was always,
"Do you have a mask?", not "Can you wear a mask?" or "You need a mask to enter here." like I heard in so many other
stores.

I do not work at Starbucks, so I can't say for sure whether these were top-down directions from the Starbucks corporate PR team or just some
 coincidence, but the phrase is pretty interesting to think about.

It implies no judgements about the person, decreasing the chance for the person to become defensive. From the perspective
of an aggressive actor, even if they tend to have hostile feelings towards masks, they have nothing to fight about because
the question isn't demanding anything of them (though
implicitly it really is). It is just a question of whether they have a mask with them or not. This contrasts what I
usually see: the staff telling the customer that they must wear a mask, to which the customer rebukes angrily that they do not.

The customer is already through the door, and they are being offered the simple solution to getting their drink - a little surgical mask. In the moment it seems
so trivial a tradeoff to either put on a mask or have their journey to get to the store be for nothing.

I noticed (though without any formal data), that much more customers would take the mask over leaving the store than customers in similar interactions at
other non-Starbucks stores.
