# Explain a topic with only common words
## Here's 1000 words. Explain a topic.

There's an old adage that claims that if you understand a topic well enough, then you can teach it in layman's terms.

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
> Albert Einstein

It's a powerful, and rare, ability to be ability to take the seemingly complex, and transform it into something
elegantly simple. Some popular efforts to do this include [WIRED's 5 Levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)
series and Randall Munroe's [Thing Explainer book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25329850-thing-explainer). In WIRED's series,
a topic expert explains a concept in 5 different levels: child, teen, college, graduate, and expert. In Thing Explainer, Munroe
explains a large list of topics using only the 1000 most common words in the English language (which itself was inspired
by a popular [XKCD commic](https://xkcd.com/1133/)).

While the latter's method isn't a fool-proof way to ensure a topic is explained "simply," it's at least a measurable
estimate. And... it's harder than you might think! I whipped up a quick text editor to play around with this concept. Pick
a topic and take a try explaining something:


<ThousandWordsTextArea />

export default ({ children }) => <BlogPostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPostLayout>
