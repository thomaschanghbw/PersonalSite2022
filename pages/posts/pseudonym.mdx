# Why I write under a pseudonym
Is it to avoid judgement? Fear of criticism? To some extent yes, though I've long since accepted that there's no
escape from these things, be it in real life or the digital world.

Knowing there's no escape from criticism, writing anonymously simply allows me to write freely without considering
any reputational effects. It doesn't matter if I write a terribly misinformed piece - someone will call out the flaws (perhaps not so nicely),
I'll learn from it, and I'll improve. At the worst case I just make a new identity 😁.

That said, if you want to see my real blog, ask me and I'll share it with you personally. Maybe.
