# Why did you...?
During my first engineering job, I decided to stop asking people *why* they make the decisions they do
(And it seems I'm not the only one;
take for example [Mark Dominus's blog post](https://blog.plover.com/tech/why-dont-you.html) or [this article](https://www.empathyrooms.com/why-not-to-use-the-word-why/) from Empathy Rooms).

But understanding *why* is the fundamental building block of understanding, so how and why would someone eliminate *why* unless they are sacrificing
work effectiveness?

The devil is not so much the idea of *why* - which is certainly important - but rather the word itself. As we often see in English,
the word is ripe for confusion.

Understanding *why* is certainly important, but I've found that the word "why" itself is

During my time at Amazon, I made the decision to remove the word "why" from my vocabulary (And it seems I'm not the only one;
take for example [Mark Dominus's blog post](https://blog.plover.com/tech/why-dont-you.html) or [this article](https://www.empathyrooms.com/why-not-to-use-the-word-why/) from Empathy Rooms).
So naturally there's the question - *why* remove why?

"Why" is certainly an important question. Asking "why" is the catalyst to understanding. But, as English often is, the word can be messy and ripe for confusion.
In particular, if you've worked in a team before, you've inevitably heard a question along the lines of, "Why did you..." or "Why didn't you just...".
And, depending on the situation, tone, and the person speaking, you've likely interpreted the question in one of
two ways:
1. What set of reasons led you to making this decision?
2. This is a dumb choice. What were you even *thinking*?

If you've heard a question like this and were left confused as to which interpretation was intended, you are not
alone.
While it's great to assume the first intention, there is certainly no shortage of people who speak with the second interpretation.
(And it seems like [others](https://blog.plover.com/tech/why-dont-you.html) have [noticed](https://www.empathyrooms.com/why-not-to-use-the-word-why/) this issue as well.).
Especially when you've invested hours or days or weeks into a task, it can feel that all your efforts have been trivialized.

Anecdotally, I've found that it eliminates a lot of confusion
and leads to better, more open discussions.

When we ask, "Why did you...?", we are attaching the decision directly to the person, even if not intended. The decision is then
tied to some intrinsic property of the person, such as their skills or their intelligence. While some people can
recognize that this is not the intention, it does require understanding of the speaker's personality and lends itself to misinterpretation.

I tend to take Mark's approach of eliminating "why" and converting every "why" question into an equivalent "what" or "how" question.
Doing so frames the situation differently. The decision is no longer a consequence of the *person*, but instead a consequence
of a *series of evidence* presented to a rationale person.
Surprisingly, it's pretty simple:
- "What led you to...?" or "How did you decide to...?" vs "Why did you...?"
- "What made you pick X over Y?" or "How does X compare to Y?" vs "Why didn't you just do X?"

After thinking about it, this is certainly not the only approach.
- Eliminating "just": "Why didn't you...?" vs "Why didn't you just...?" (decent)
- Adding context: "I think I'm missing some key details, why didn't you...?" (better)
- Eliminating "you": "I think I'm missing some key details, why not...?" (even better)

of course with friends and people or high rapport, not an issue. But it takes a while to get close to someone, especially in a professional setting.

When "why" is attached is attached to you, you open up a rabithole of interpretations. Are they talking about my thought process, or intellect?
Well either way its personal. It's best to disassociate the person and their decision, instead framing the situation as
one rationale person being led to a decision by a set of evidence.

"I'm probably missing something - why didn't you just do X?"

spent hours or weeks or months to be boiled down to a trivial, why didnt you

I like to use basically this, combined with brlewis's suggestion to take them out of the phrasing, when I'm erring on the side of being approachable. So maybe "I think I'm missing something here - why not use sshd?".


In fact, after thinking about the word in length, "why" has become a word I've virtually eliminated from my vocabulary.

What exactly is the problem with why?

obama and translator - theory - make these as close together as possible
