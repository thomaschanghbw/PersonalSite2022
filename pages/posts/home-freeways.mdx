# Buying a Home: Freeway Proximity
When buying a home, stay close to the freeway.[^1] The freeway is your gateway to the world outside your city, and your proximity to the
freeway will influence how long it takes to access other cities and how often you will want to.

My drive to LA takes 45 minutes. 15 of those minutes are spent going from my home to the freeway, meaning 1/3 of the
travel is spent stuck within my own city. There are even some homes in this city that take up to 25 minutes to access the freeway.
You don't want to deal with this for years.

[^1]: As always, there are always exceptions and everyone has different circumstances, so this does not apply to everyone (or even a majority).
