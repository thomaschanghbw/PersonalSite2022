# A Hitchhikers Guide to Hackernews
This is Fred.

He wants to post on Hackernews. Well, Fred has come to the right place.
So you want to post on Hackernews. Well, you've come to the right place.

I love Hackernews. I've been a user for years and probably visit much more often than I should. There's just so many interesting
things to learn. For instance â€” maybe it's better to toss plastic in the trash than recycle it. Who knew! So let's help
Fred prepare his post for Hackernews.

Fred is worried because he thinks Hackernews is toxic (It seems even Hackernews thinks Hackernews is toxic, as every now
and then a post https://kg.dev/thoughts/i-love-you-hn-but-youre-toxic about it will make its way to the front page.) Funnily enough,
most replies are the non-toxic part of the community discussing, while probably the toxic ones don't even realize what
is going on.

And given HN's predominantly **male**, tech-bro audience, Fred must be vigilent. There are folks on-reserve, salivating at the
chance to feel superior to Fred. Fred just wants to put his ideas out into the world and have
thoughtful discussions, but he must first make impervious to attack.

But in all seriousness. What's most important in life? Feeling superior or feeling kind?

reflexively contrarian. easy to be a critic.

Why write online? When I was younger I worried of scrutiny. You can see in HN that many posts are shot down with criticism
in the comments. People there are reflexively contrarian which may deter you from writing anything online at all. Often times
the replies are phrased abrasively rather than gently (see this post for a hilarious chain of comments as people try to
explain to someone why their comment is abrasive, to which he doesn't accept). But there's a certain comfort to be gained
in knowing that people will likely shoot down your idea. "It's easy to be a critic" they say. I feel that I was this way before too.
I would go through each batch of YC startups and laugh at how "bad" of an idea it was.

But once you accept that there will always be someone online looking down at you, it becomes liberating. There's no longer
this need to qualify everything and list out all the exceptions (which someone will definitely point out). Just write your
thoughts.

And oftentimes, people are wrong. People scrutinized coinbase and look where they are now. Critics are the greatest
blessing because they excuse themselves from competing with you. Imagine how much harder it would be to be the best chess
player if all 8 billion people on the planet were obsessed about chess.

Be grateful. Some jerk overly obsessed with his car as a status symbol? Some man who seeks refuge in racism to resolve whatever
internal turmoil they have? Be grateful. Hackernews' reflexively contrarian responses with abrasive language to your new
opinions and ideas? Be grateful. It would be much harder to be the greatest chess player if everyone was playing against you
with the same intensity and passion.
